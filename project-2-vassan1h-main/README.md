# Project 2 Template Repo

This repo contains all of the necessary files and structure for project 2.
Please note that I have provided you with CSV samplesheets pointing to the
files stored in our shared class space. Also take a look through the nextflow.config
as I have pre-encoded the paths to a few of the critical files needed for
your workflow.

## Directions for Project 2

You may find the directions for each week of project 2 in `refs/` as well
as in the textbook if you prefer (https://bu-bioinfo.github.io/bf528/week-1-chipseq.html)

Please push your progress regularly to this repo and on each following Friday
with your completed tasks for the previous week.
